Managed code :

Managed code is executed directly by the CLR(Common Language Runtime) instead of the operating system.
This code doesn't depend on machine configurations and can be executed on different machines. 
Managed code also provides platform independence. 
In .NET Framework Managed Code runs within the .Net Framework’s CLR.


As the managed code is first compiled to intermediate language, 
the CLR’s JIT Compiler takes care of compiling this intermediate language into the architecture specific instructions. 
the CLR internally uses the Garbage Collector to clear the unused memory.
It also offers services like run-time type checking, reference checking,memory management, destruction of unused Objects etc.

Unmanaged Code:

Unmanaged code is executed directly by the operating system outside the CLR environment.
It is directly compiled to native machine code which depends on the machine configuration. 
This means that if you want to run the same code on different architecture then 
you will have to recompile the code using that particular architecture. 
In unmanaged code the memory allocation, type safety, security, etc needs to be taken care of by the developer.
